/**
 * By default a Realm can stores all RealmClasses in a project. However, if you want to restrict a Realm to only contain
 * certain classes or want to share them between a library project and an app project you must use a RealmModule.
 * <p>
 * A RealmModule is a collection of RealmClasses that can be combined with other RealmModules to create the schema for a
 * Realm. This makes it easier to control versioning and migration of those Realms.
 * <p>
 * A RealmModule can either be a library module or an app module. This distinction is made by setting
 * {@code library = true}. A default Realm will automatically create a RealmModule called {@code DefaulRealmModule}
 * that contains all RealmClasses in a project. This module will be an app module and is automatically known by Realm.
 * <p>
 * This behavior is problematic when combining a library project and an app project that both uses Realm as
 * the {@code DefaultRealmModule} will be created for both the library project and the app project causing import
 * conflicts.
 * <p>
 * Library authors are reponsible for avoiding this conflict by creating a explicit library module where
 * {@code library = true} is set. This disable the generation of the DefaultRealmModule for the library project and
 * allows the library to be included in the app project that also uses Realm. This means that library projects that uses
 * Realm internally are required to specify a explicit module using {@code RealmConfiguration.setModules()}.
 * <p>
 * App developers are not required to specify any modules, as they implicitely use the {@code DefaultRealmModule}, but
 * they now has the option of adding the library project classes to their schema using
 * {@code RealmConfiguration.addModule()}.
 *
 * @see <a href="">TODO Example of a project using modules</a>
